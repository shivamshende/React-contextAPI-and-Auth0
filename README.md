# Getting Started

## React + Vite Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Two official plugins are available for handling Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This alternative uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Feel free to choose the plugin that best fits your preferences or project requirements.
