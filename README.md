# Getting Started

## React + Vite Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Two official plugins are available for handling Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This alternative uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Feel free to choose the plugin that best fits your preferences or project requirements.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd <project-directory>

3. Install dependencies:

npm install

4. Running the App:

npm run dev

## Skills

This project showcases the use of various technologies and skills, including:

- **React.js:** Leveraging the power of React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **React Hooks:** Specifically, the useAuth0 hook from the '@auth0/auth0-react' library is used in both the 'LoginLogout' and 'Profile' components. This hook provides authentication-related functionality to these components.

- **Context API:** The project utilizes the Context API in React for managing authentication state. This is evident in the 'LoginLogout' component where it mentions the utilization of Context API to manage authentication.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** The project implements user authentication and authorization using Auth0. Auth0 provides authentication as a service, allowing developers to easily add authentication features to their applications.

- **Vite:** Employing Vite as the build tool for fast and efficient development and bundling.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling the application using the utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.

- **npm:** Managing project dependencies and scripts using the Node Package Manager.

- **Node.js:** Providing the runtime environment for building and running JavaScript applications.

- **Git:** Version control and collaboration using Git for tracking changes and managing project history.

## Help / Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, consider the following advice for common problems:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Node.js and npm Version:**
   - Ensure you have a compatible version of Node.js installed. This project is designed to work with Node.js version 14.x or later. You can check your Node.js version by running:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   Update Node.js if needed: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. **Installation Failures:**
   - If you face issues during the installation of dependencies, try running:
     ```bash
     npm install --legacy-peer-deps
     ```
   This can sometimes resolve compatibility problems with peer dependencies.

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   - If the development server fails to start due to a port conflict, you can specify a different port using:
     ```bash
     npm run dev -- --port <desired-port>
     ```
